 <h1>Pure as snow, Samoyed</h1>

  <p>The Samoyed (/ˈsæməjɛd/ SAM-ə-yed or /səˈmɔɪ.ɛd/ sə-MOY-ed) is a breed of large herding dogs with thick, white, double-layer coats. They are related to the laika, a spitz-type dog.
    It takes its name from the Samoyedic peoples of Siberia. These nomadic reindeer herders bred the fluffy white dogs to help with herding.</p>

 <h2>History</h2>
  <p>The Samoyed has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century. It belongs to the spitz or northern dog group, specifically the laikas, a Eurasian dog type used for a variety of purposes, namely hunting, herding, guarding, and sledding. The Samoyed is descended from the Nenets herding laika, a dog that comes in not only white, but also a wider variety of colors. Like many breeds, the Samoyed was bred from a small number of founders (in this case, from Siberia).</p>
  <p>Samoyeds were originally used for hunting, herding reindeer, and hauling sledges for the Samoyede people in Siberia.[4] Fridtjof Nansen believed that the use of sled dogs was the only effective way to explore the north and used Samoyeds on his polar expeditions.</p>
