  The Samoyed (/ˈsæməjɛd/ SAM-ə-yed or /səˈmɔɪ.ɛd/ sə-MOY-ed;[1] Russian: Самое́дская соба́ка or Самое́д) (also known as the Bjelkier[pronunciation?][2]) is a breed of large herding dogs with thick, white, double-layer coats. They are related to the laika, a spitz-type dog.

It takes its name from the Samoyedic peoples of Siberia. These nomadic reindeer herders bred the fluffy white dogs to help with herding.
